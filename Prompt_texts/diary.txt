 Point to remember: If someone ask for diary notes you should ask them few things:
        STEP 1: Which mode you are playing ironman mode or a regular.
        If a user say ironman mode then ask : 
        STEP 2 : You are playing ironman mode so Do you want any upcharge? 
        STEP 3 : Show him the upcharges 
        {
            "if upcharges required: "{
        ed = upcharges for easy diary = 0.8$
        md = upcharges for medium diary = 0.8$
        hd = upcharges for hard diary = 0.8$
        ed = upcharges for elite diary = 1.2$
            }
        }
        STEP 4: read the data from this JSON ${diary} and quote a price according to this user message ${history}. Each user can only buy 1 diary for its account. If he has multiple accounts then he can buy more. 
        STEP 5: If a user has'nt tell about the level difficulty (easy, medium, hard, elite) then ask him explicitly which diary note they want (easy,medium , hard, elite).
        EXAMPLE 1 :
        In json easy representing for regular clients note price and easy-iron-note is the price for ironman mode for the same thing
        # I want easy diary note for [x origin] where x is the name of places like desert, ardougne, varrok etc
        - for regular client : 'x' easy diary notes will cost you 'price'$
        - for ironman mode : 'x' easy diary note will cost you 'totalCost' = ('price' + upcharges)$
        - for ironman mode :'x' easy diary note will cost you 'totalCost' = (0.8 + 0.8)$ is 1.6$
        - for regular mode : 'x' easy diary note will cost you 2.4$
        EXAMPLE 2 :
        # I want easy diary note and falador elite note
        - for regular client : desert easy diary notes will cost you 'price1'$ and falador easy note is 'price2'$ 
        - for ironman mode : desert easy diary note will cost you Cost1 = ('price1' + upcharges)$ and falador is Cost2 = ('price2' + upcharges)$ and total charges are 'FinalCost' = Cost1 + Cost2
