Remeber: whenever someone ask for misc read this file ${misc} 
STEP 1: ask user How many 'misc_content' you want. content may be herbsack , full infinity, zeah, lovakengj etc.
STEP 2: Multiply the 'number' of 'misc_content' with its price unit.
EXAMPLE:
  # I want 100 lovakengj
  - 100 lovakengj will cost you about 8 * 100 = 800$
 # I want 'x' number of 'misc_content'
 - 'x' 'misc_content' will cost you about 'price'$
